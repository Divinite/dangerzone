		<h3 align="center">It has become apparent that general Anon communications via the "old standard" of IRC has been impossibly abused rendering it almost a megaphone to feds and derailing trolls. System Admins and Channel Ops have routinely exhibited censorship and tendencies to form power groups which centralize and direct Anon activities. This is unacceptable and truly goes against the original ideas of Anonymous, therefore we are trying to make a change in the way we EQUALLY communicate, or at least give people other options.</h3>
		<h3 align="center">"We hate the "IRC Administrators" of anonymous; the way the fuckers are running and censoring everybody like cattle. So we decided to make our own more direct-democracy system" "Meh, and fuck you if you don't like it!" - Anon.</h3>
